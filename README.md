## Question 1:  
   - Me:  
     - How does the level of a programming language (low-level vs. high-level) impact productivity,control over function, and performance optimization?
   - ChatGPT:  
     - 1. Productivity
          - High-level languages (e.g., Python, Java, C#) are designed to be more abstract and closer to human language. They simplify many tasks, offering features like automatic memory management, built-in libraries, and easier syntax. This allows developers to write less code to achieve the same functionality, significantly improving productivity.
